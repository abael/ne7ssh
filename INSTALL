Basic Installation Instructions
===============================

The simplest way to compile this package that should work on all platforms
is to change to the directory containing the package's source code and type:

        python botan.py
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake ..
        cmake --build . --target install --config Release

===============================

   These are generic installation instructions.

    NetSiben SSH Library requires Botan crypto library 1.10.

    The Botan library can be found here: http://botan.randombit.net
    To compile botan 1.10 for use with ne7ssh on *nix:

    Botan can be fully built and locally installed for ne7ssh with
    the included python script:
    botan.py

    Running that script will download, configure and compile botan.

    If there are problems with the script then an overview of how to
    build botan 1.10 is as follows:

    ./configure.py --disable-asm --disable-shared
    make -j install

    To compile botan 1.10 for use with ne7ssh on Windows:

    configure.py --cc=msvc --cpu=i386 --disable-shared
    nmake install

   NetSieben SSH Library requires Cmake. Cmake software can be found here:
